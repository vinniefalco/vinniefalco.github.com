		<blockquote>
			"Users of commercial software who immediately upgrade to newer versions
			of an application expect to find improvements. Instead, they often find
			useful features removed, new or unfixed bugs, reduced performance, or
			non-productive changes to the user interface. These users have no recourse,
			since many of these niche applications are available from only one or two
			large companies...until now."

			"The Wall of Endless Boxes" by Vinnie Falco

		</p>

		<p>
			A point in time came where my home office melted down due to very old
			"uninterruptible" power supplies getting interrupted (the lead-acid
			batteries only last a few years and mine were ancient). This resulted in a
			burst of purchases of electronics. I usually save boxes for a week before I
			throw them out, in case I need to return an item. As they started to pile
			up by the door, I realized they could be turned into art. The wall was
			born.

			I encourage unlimited commercial usage of this artwork, including
			'mashups', as long as the attribution remains intact.

			"The Making of the Wall of Endless Boxes" by Vinnie Falco
		</h3>

		<blockquote>
			"When the opportunity to 'look behind the curtain' presents itself we must
			take advantage of it..."

		<a href="downloads/TheMakingOfTheWallOfEndlessBoxes.jpg">

		</p>

		<p>
			The Wall of Endless Boxes was created and conceived by me, while the
			photography work was done by Dean Mongan from
			<a href="http://monganmedia.com">MonganMedia</a>. During the shooting of
			the work, I shot the "making of" using a separate camera. After the actual
			artwork was shot, I held an "open house" where neighbors could come by and
			have their picture taken in front of the wall. This picture give you an
			idea of the scale of the wall and the work required for the setup. Dean
			is a master of not only photography and lighting, but also videography
			and video post-production. All equipment including the Canon EOS 5D Mark
			II and the Arrilite three point lighting system is property of
			One Guy Group, Inc.

		<p>
			I encourage unlimited non-commercial distribution of this artwork, as long
			as the attribution remains intact.
