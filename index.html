	What's a OneGuy&#8482;?
</h3>

<blockquote>
	"Users of commercial software who immediately upgrade to newer versions
	of an application expect to find improvements. Instead, they often find
	useful features removed, new or unfixed bugs, reduced performance, or
	non-productive changes to the user interface. These users have no recourse,
	since many of these niche applications are available from only one or two
	large companies...until now."

	A point in time came where my home office melted down due to very old
	"uninterruptible" power supplies getting interrupted (the lead-acid
	batteries only last a few years and mine were ancient). This resulted in a
	burst of purchases of electronics. I usually save boxes for a week before I
	throw them out, in case I need to return an item. As they started to pile
	up by the door, I realized they could be turned into art. The wall was
	born.

	The Wall of Endless Boxes was created and conceived by me, while the
	photography work was done by Dean Mongan from
	<a href="http://monganmedia.com">MonganMedia</a>. During the shooting of
	the work, I shot the "making of" using a separate camera. After the actual
	artwork was shot, I held an "open house" where neighbors could come by and
	have their picture taken in front of the wall. This picture give you an
	idea of the scale of the wall and the work required for the setup. Dean
	is a master of not only photography and lighting, but also videography
	and video post-production. All equipment including the Canon EOS 5D Mark
	II and the Arrilite three point lighting system is property of
	One Guy Group, Inc.
